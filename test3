HI Mythily,
 
I'm only concerned about the professional 837 xml file, which I specified in the text. I can't help much with field mapping because I'm unfamiliar with the domain. 
If I accidentally included not found for other types Institutional or Dental, please disregard it.
I send you the document  solely to determine why too many fields are not detected for professional. Please verify it.
 
Regards,
Abhinav

Hi Abhinav,
 
The requirement document contains fields which includes for all claim types but the XML you have shared only contains fields for professional claim types. As a result, you won't find all the fields listed in the requirement document.
I’ve scheduled some time tomorrow to discuss this. Meantime, could you please update and share the latest Swagger? It’s on our priority list for tomorrow.
 
 
Best,
Mythily

Hi Mythily,
 
I have taken updated specification file and compare all data from Professional 837 data file and found most of them missing in file. I have added comment and path where I tried to get the data. Most of them required filed but still data is not there.
All of my logic to parse the data is based on data file and mapping ,specifically where data is in array/list form. Please have a review and let me know if any other sample file which contain all data so that I can complete all logic.
Based on your input I will work on parsing logic further if some data not found then it is ok but give your comment on attached file.
 
Regards,
Abhinav
