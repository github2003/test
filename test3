Since **removing sonar issues took 3 days**, you now have the following work left:  

1. **Change Oracle to PostgreSQL**  
2. **Modify file handling (NFS â†’ S3 for input, final XML to S3)**  
3. **Write JUnit tests**  
4. **CI/CD setup using an existing template**  

### **Effort Estimation for Remaining Work**  

| Task | Estimated Time |
|-------|---------------|
| **Oracle â†’ PostgreSQL** | **0.5 day** |
| **Modify file handling (NFS â†’ S3)** | **1.5 days** |
| **Write JUnit tests** | **1 day** |
| **CI/CD setup and testing** | **0.5 day** |

âž¡ **Total Remaining Effort: ~3.5 days**  

Since you've already **spent 3 days**, the overall effort for this ticket is around **6.5 days**, which is slightly high for a 3-point story. If needed, you can discuss increasing it to **5 points**.  

---

### **Updated Sub-Tasks & Details**  

#### **1. Database Migration: Oracle â†’ PostgreSQL (0.5 Day) â†’ 0.5 SP**  
- Modify queries and update connection properties.  
- Ensure the transformed XML data is retrieved correctly.  
âœ… **Acceptance Criteria:**  
- PostgreSQL integration is functional.  
- All queries return expected data without errors.  

---

#### **2. Update File Handling (NFS â†’ S3) (1.5 Days) â†’ 1.5 SP**  
- Read input files from **S3** instead of NFS.  
- Ensure the final transformed XML is stored in **S3**.  
âœ… **Acceptance Criteria:**  
- XML input files are read from S3.  
- Final transformed XML is correctly written to S3.  

---

#### **3. Write JUnit Tests (1 Day) â†’ 1 SP**  
- Write test cases for **database interaction and file handling changes**.  
âœ… **Acceptance Criteria:**  
- At least **80% coverage** for the modified code.  

---

#### **4. CI/CD Integration (0.5 Day) â†’ 0.5 SP**  
- Ensure the updated code is deployed via an existing **CI/CD template**.  
âœ… **Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The application builds and deploys successfully.  

---

### **Main Ticket: Acceptance Criteria**  

âœ… **Oracle is replaced with PostgreSQL, and data retrieval works as expected.**  
âœ… **File handling is updated to use S3 instead of NFS.**  
âœ… **JUnit tests are added, and coverage is at least 80%.**  
âœ… **CI/CD pipeline builds and deploys successfully.**  
âœ… **No Sonar issues remain in the code.**

Since you only have **~3.5 days of work left**, try to complete it within this sprint.  
If this effort feels **too high for a 3-point story**, you can discuss increasing it to **5 points** with the team. ðŸš€

Write unit tests for all components.

Integrate CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

Acceptance Criteria:
PostgreSQL connection is established and working.

XML is retrieved successfully from the new database.

XML parsing using JAXB is implemented correctly.

Mapper correctly transforms data into the Swagger response model.

Unit tests cover all major functionalities.

CI/CD pipeline builds and deploys the service successfully.

Sub-tasks:
1. Analysis
Understand the existing Oracle-based implementation.

Identify PostgreSQL schema, tables, and queries required.

Validate XML structure and transformation logic.

Acceptance Criteria:

Document the Oracle-to-PostgreSQL mapping.

Identify required changes in XML processing.

2. Database Connection and Code Changes
Configure PostgreSQL connection in the application.

Modify existing logic to fetch XML from PostgreSQL instead of Oracle.

Validate retrieved XML against expected structure.

Acceptance Criteria:

Application successfully retrieves XML from PostgreSQL.

No breaking changes in the existing flow.

3. XML Parsing and Mapper Implementation
Implement JAXB-based XML parsing.

Develop a mapper to transform parsed data into Swagger response classes.

Acceptance Criteria:

XML is correctly converted into Java objects.

Mapper correctly transforms parsed data into Swagger response format.

4. Unit Testing
Write unit tests for database fetching logic.

Validate JAXB XML parsing through unit tests.

Test mapper functionality with various XML inputs.

Acceptance Criteria:

Code coverage is at least 80%.

All critical paths are tested.

5. CI/CD Integration
Update existing CI/CD pipeline to deploy the service.

Ensure database migrations are handled if needed.

Acceptance Criteria:

CI/CD pipeline builds and deploys successfully.

Service is up and running after deployment.
