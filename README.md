Just to clarify, I don’t have any outstanding questions—my only request is straightforward: I need clear mapping for the Professional 837 XML fields to align with the requirement document. Without this, I can’t proceed with the parsing logic. I’ve been raising this for the past week, and I’d appreciate if the team could take ownership of providing the necessary details.

I’m only concerned about the Professional 837 XML file, which I specified earlier. I can’t help much with field mapping since I’m unfamiliar with the healthcare domain. If I accidentally mentioned "not found" for other types like Institutional or Dental, please disregard that. I sent the document solely to determine why so many fields are not detected for Professional. Please verify it.
